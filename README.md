## Development Instructions

### Quick Setup

After cloning the repository, pull all the JavaScript dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the [WebPack DevServer](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/), which hot-reloads all changes you make:

```bash
npm run start
```

The app can be viewed in your browser at http://localhost:3000
